# Data-Preprocessing-Project
This is a Medical Data which includes some Features and Target . I prepared it before the Training step.

The goal is to classify Is the person has diabets or Not.

The Data include the following Columns:

Features:
  
  Pregnancies	- Glucose - BloodPressure	- SkinThickness	- Insulin	- BMI	- DiabetesPedigreeFunction	- Age	

Target:
  
  Outcome

Steps of Data Processing I made:
  
  Step 1: Import Libraries and Load Dataset
  
  Step 2: Inspect Data Structure and Check Missing Values
  
  Step 3: Statistical Summary and Visualizing Outliers
  
  Step 4: Remove Outliers Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) Method
  
  Step 5: Correlation Analysis
  
  Step 6: Visualize Target Variable Distribution
  
  Step 7: Separate Features and Target Variable
  
  Step 8: Feature Scaling: Normalization and Standardization


 The Shape of Data before applying preproccessing is: (768 Rows, 9 columns) 
 
 The Shape of Data after applying preproccessing is: (676 Rows, 9 columns) 


What is the Purpose of Data Preprocessing:

  1- Improves Data Quality: Cleans and organizes raw data for better analysis.

  2- Reduces Overfitting: Handles outliers and redundant features, improving model generalization.

  So Now the Data is Ready for The Model Training Step.
